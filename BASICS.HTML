        <h1>Jude Bellingham 🤯</h1>

        <p>Jude Bellingham ran the midfield like he had admin privileges, casually making world-class defenders look like NPCs. Every touch, pass, and run felt like he was scripting a Hollywood thriller—with City’s defense as the unfortunate extras.</p>

        <p>Jude Bellingham spent the entire match against Man City looking like a man on a mission—except the mission was just chaos. At one point, he dribbled past three defenders so effortlessly that even Guardiola looked like he wanted to sub himself in. Then, in classic Jude fashion, he threw in a dramatic late run, causing City's defense to collectively experience an existential crisis. Somewhere in the chaos, he probably whispered, "This is my world, you're just playing in it." Meanwhile, Haaland stood there, wondering if switching to midfield would get him more action.</p>

        <h1>Staying Humble eh</h1>

        <p>Mbappé didn’t just score a hat-trick—he turned the Etihad into his personal playground. Every time he got the ball, City’s defense looked like they were buffering, and by the time his third goal went in, even Guardiola’s tactical notebook probably just said, **“Pray.”** It wasn’t just speed, it was **pure inevitability**, as if he decided before kickoff that **Man City simply wasn’t winning this game.**  

        From the first whistle, Mbappé played like a man on a **revenge tour**, cutting through defenders like they were part of the warm-up drill. His acceleration made Walker—one of the fastest full-backs in the world—look like he was running in **slow motion**, and his finishing was so disrespectful it could be classified as a crime. By the end, even Haaland had that look of **"Yeah, that guy's different."**  
        
        It wasn’t just a performance, it was a **statement**—a reminder that when Mbappé is locked in, there’s not a single defense on the planet that can stop him.</p>
